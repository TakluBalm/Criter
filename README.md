Terminal Based text-editor

Just trying to learn the input-output operations using C. 
The idea is to make a text editor that takes a filename(existing/non-existing) as argument and open it and change its contents.
The aim is to make the cursor move in the editor in any way we want so that the user doesn't get confused. Also we must be able to insert words anywhere in the text
